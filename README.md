# Deep-Learning-Final-Project

The repository consists of pre-processing code and data (in image-caption -> code_data folder) and two colab notebooks (one is our implementation, one is original implementation). To run the notebook, we need to upload the data (images_new and captions.txt) from the code_data folder into our google drive, put them in the same folder (mine is called CSCI 1470 Final Project) as the colab notebooks. To see the results, we could run everything in the final_results_5.12 notebook. 

This is our google drive folder for reference. Note that we can find images in this folder, not the Github folder - it was too large so we were not able to push it:
